This was a homework assignment for my Systems programming class. We were tasked with writing a simple shell script that allowed for
a single pipeline ("|") and a single semicolon chain. I wanted to make a usable script, so I wrote mine to handle indefinite pipelining
and semicolon chaining.

I wrote this in a UNIX-based environment, and compiled it using gcc.
